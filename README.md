# CVE-2018-10933
CVE-2018-10933 libssh authentication bypass, vulnerable Docker container that listens on port 2222
for exploitation. A crude proof-of-concept is included in the container to bypass auth.

bc.. ssh -l myuser 127.0.0.1 -p 2222
password (mypassword)

p. to use a patched library and test the authentication bypass (output on the console) you can use
the exploit-libssh-0.8.3 examples which provide SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS due to a modified header file
instead of SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS. 

bc.. /root/exploit-libssh-0.8.3/build/examples/ssh-client -l myuser 127.0.0.1
