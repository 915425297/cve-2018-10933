# CVE-2018-10933
CVE-2018-10933 libssh authentication bypass, vulnerable Docker container that listens on port 2222
for exploitation. A basic proof-of-concept patch included in the container to bypass auth. To login
use the default "myuser" / "mypassword" from libssh. A patch is applied to a copy of libssh in 
the Docker container which injects a SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS packet during any authentication 
type (keyboard-interactive / pubkey / gss-api etc.) attempt and sets the client side state.

```
./build.sh
./run.sh
ssh -l myuser -p 2222 localhost
```

A patched exploit-libssh-0.8.3 and examples are available in the container for testing purposes.
The "ssh-client" will successfully bypass authentication but is unable to spawn a shell.

``` 
[root@305b48cb932e examples]# ./ssh-client -l root 127.0.0.1
The server is unknown. Do you trust the host key (yes/no)?
SHA256:Mg6j2yHWMsRe56ABhAYjLIJK9yD2N3lGQAl3EfGqP7w
yes
This new key will be written on disk for further usage. do you agree ?
yes
Requesting shell : Channel request shell failed
[root@305b48cb932e examples]# 
```

The following libssh debug output shows authentication has succeeded on the server and a session
channel has been created. The state machine appears to be broken here and attempts to run commands
or start a pty/shell errors. An attacker could still attempt to tunnel/proxy connections through
the service.

libssh is installed locally on a number of *BSD & Linux distributions as is used by ffmpeg (?), hydra
and a small number of FOSS packages.
